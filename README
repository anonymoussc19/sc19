Analytical Cache Modeling and Tilesize Optimization for Tensor Contractions

Run solver: 
change "module load" in ./runsolver.sh according to your env, run runsolver.sh will automatically download solver, and dump solving result under tool/build/bdwl_tiles or skyl_tiles.  Tile size options are at the tail of the file.  A flooring/ceiling operation might be needed before we use the tile size, to make sure the higher tile size are divisible by the lower.

#####Ignore this if previous script works
Please download AMPL interface at: 
https://ampl.com/products/
(Try to download the demo version if you don't want to buy)
https://ampl.com/try-ampl/download-a-free-demo/

Please download opensource solver at : https://projects.coin-or.org/Couenne
Or if you cannot compile, download Couenne binary at https://ampl.com/products/solvers/open-source/#bonmin
Add the binaries to $PATH
check the CMakeList.txt under tool/src, build it use cmake.
move the couenne.opt and tileinput.txt to where you build and run the Tool binary.

After compile
For broadwell arch:

run   "./Tool tile_input.txt ccsdt broadwell"      
for tile size solving following bench:
abcdef-****-****

run "./Tool tile_input.txt ccsd broadwell"
 for tile size solving following bench:
abcd-****-**** all size 72

run "./Tool tile_input.txt abc-ad-312 broadwell"
 for tile size solving following bench:
abc-acd-db
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312
abc-ad-bdc	  
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312
abc-adc-bd
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312
abc-adc-db
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt ab312 broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
ab-***-***

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abcd-ea broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abcd-e*-****

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abc-dc-24  broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abc-bda-dc

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abcd-ebad broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abcd-****-**

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abcde broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abcde-*****-**

Replace the "broadwell" in command to "skylake" to run solver for skylake













Run Code using the tile size solution:
under test folder, there are <arch>_ccsdt, <arch>_ccsd, and <arch>_others folder
run ./run.sh
