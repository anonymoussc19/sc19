move the couenne.opt and tileinput.txt to where you build and run the Tool binary.



After compile
For broadwell arch:

run   "./Tool tile_input.txt ccsdt broadwell"      
for tile size solving following bench:
abcdef-****-****

run "./Tool tile_input.txt ccsd broadwell"
 for tile size solving following bench:
abcd-****-**** all size 72

run "./Tool tile_input.txt abc-ad-312 broadwell"
 for tile size solving following bench:
abc-acd-db
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312
abc-ad-bdc	  
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312
abc-adc-bd
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312
abc-adc-db
a:312 b:312 c:312 d:312

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt ab312 broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
ab-***-***

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abcd-ea broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abcd-e*-****

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abc-dc-24  broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abc-bda-dc

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abcd-ebad broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abcd-****-**

run " ./Tool tile_input.txt abcde broadwell" for tile size solving following bench:
abcde-*****-**



Replace the "broadwell" in command to "skylake" to run solver for skylake




TEST:
under test folder, there are <arch>_ccsdt, <arch>_ccsd, and <arch>_others folder

run ./run.sh
